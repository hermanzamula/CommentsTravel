I would recommend this as maybe a little higher than PG 13. I was not expecting the \"f\" bomb quite as much but then it was about New Jersey.",

Attractions are waiting to be explored and our conveniently located hotels and condos are just minutes from everything including art festivals and sporting events. Corpus Christi is an attractive location for the whole family!",
